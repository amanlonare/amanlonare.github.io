<div style="text-align: justify">
For my Master’s Thesis at the Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas, IIT Bombay, an interdisciplinary department focused on improving agricultural productivity in India, I developed a web portal for farmers, government agencies, and sugarcane mills to enable real-time crop monitoring using remote sensing in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using CNN models on open-source satellite imagery, Sentinel and LANDSAT, the system achieved 78% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.8 in crop yield prediction. The portal contributed to a 15% increase in the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugarcane by enhancing supply chain efficiency and reducing spoilage.

<div style="text-align: justify">For my project on Near Real-Time Data Replication from MySQL to PostgreSQL, I built a change data capture (CDC) pipeline using Debezium, Kafka, and Docker for seamless, low-latency data replication. I analyzed change data events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) from MySQL, streamed them to Kafka, and replicated them to PostgreSQL in a fully containerized setup. This project showcases my expertise in data streaming, infrastructure automation, and scalable data pipelines. It has real-world applications in real-time analytics, cross-database synchronization, and cloud migrations, enabling fault-tolerant, downtime-free data integration across diverse environments.</div>

### Performance Testing of RDS MySQL Database using sysbench

[![Read on Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-Read_on_Medium-blue?logo=medium)](https://medium.com/@amanlonare/performance-testing-of-rds-mysql-database-using-sysbench-d95eca450fa7)

<div style="text-align: justify">For my project on Performance Testing of Amazon RDS MySQL, I implemented a benchmarking framework using sysbench to evaluate database performance under different workloads. I deployed an Amazon EC2 instance to generate synthetic queries against an RDS MySQL database while monitoring key metrics like query latency, CPU utilization, and IOPS using Amazon CloudWatch. This project demonstrates my expertise in database performance optimization, cloud infrastructure, and benchmarking techniques. It has real-world applications in database capacity planning, optimizing cloud costs, and ensuring high-performance database configurations for scalable applications.</div>
