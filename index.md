### Agentic Document Extraction for Filling the Application Form

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project showcases an advanced intelligent form-filling agent built using LlamaIndex's workflow framework to orchestrate complex AI-driven processes within an event-driven architecture. It integrates Groq's LLM for sophisticated natural language understanding and generation, while leveraging Hugging Face embedding models for high-dimensional vector representations. The system employs vector store indexing for efficient document retrieval, enabling contextual augmentation of LLM-generated outputs for enhanced accuracy. Designed as an automation tool for extracting and populating form fields, the agent dynamically processes structured and unstructured data sources, such as user-provided documents (e.g., resumes). Furthermore, it incorporates a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism, acknowledging the role of LLMs as augmentative rather than autonomous systems. Based on user feedback, the system iteratively refines its responses, ensuring improved accuracy and alignment with human intent.

<div style="text-align: justify">
For my Master’s Thesis at the Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas, IIT Bombay, an interdisciplinary department focused on improving agricultural productivity in India, I developed a web portal for farmers, government agencies, and sugarcane mills to enable real-time crop monitoring using remote sensing in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using CNN models on open-source satellite imagery, Sentinel and LANDSAT, the system achieved 78% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.8 in crop yield prediction. The portal contributed to a 15% increase in the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugarcane by enhancing supply chain efficiency and reducing spoilage.

[![Read on Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-Read_on_Medium-blue?logo=medium)](https://medium.com/@amanlonare/near-real-time-data-replication-from-mysql-to-postgresql-ii-3c8d7a56cc8f)

<div style="text-align: justify">For my project on Near Real-Time Data Replication from MySQL to PostgreSQL, I built a change data capture (CDC) pipeline using Debezium, Kafka, and Docker for seamless, low-latency data replication. I analyzed change data events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) from MySQL, streamed them to Kafka, and replicated them to PostgreSQL in a fully containerized setup. This project showcases my expertise in data streaming, infrastructure automation, and scalable data pipelines. It has real-world applications in real-time analytics, cross-database synchronization, and cloud migrations, enabling fault-tolerant, downtime-free data integration across diverse environments.</div>

### Performance Testing of RDS MySQL Database using sysbench

[![Read on Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-Read_on_Medium-blue?logo=medium)](https://medium.com/@amanlonare/performance-testing-of-rds-mysql-database-using-sysbench-d95eca450fa7)

<div style="text-align: justify">For my project on Performance Testing of Amazon RDS MySQL, I implemented a benchmarking framework using sysbench to evaluate database performance under different workloads. I deployed an Amazon EC2 instance to generate synthetic queries against an RDS MySQL database while monitoring key metrics like query latency, CPU utilization, and IOPS using Amazon CloudWatch. This project demonstrates my expertise in database performance optimization, cloud infrastructure, and benchmarking techniques. It has real-world applications in database capacity planning, optimizing cloud costs, and ensuring high-performance database configurations for scalable applications.</div>
